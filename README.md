# UmbracoTutorial
Source code for the tutorial at https://youtu.be/VWy2HlRDCRM

I left out the web.config (you will have your own generated) as it contained some senstive key information.

Anyhow, this should save you a ton of typing should you choose to take the above tutorial on Umbraco.

A little bit of the work that I am doing involves Umbraco.  I found this fabulous tutorial above and went thru it a while back and wanted to make the code available for anyone who does not want to do a bunch of typing but would rather do a bit of cut/copy/paste.
